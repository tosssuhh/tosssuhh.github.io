Thank you for downloading my overlay :D

If you don't already know how to add a controller overlay
I recommend this tutorial on youtube:

Watch until 1:21 then skip to 15:00

Written instructions:
Go to https://github.com and create an account if you haven't already.
Create a new repository at the top left with the green "New" button
or go to your profile picture at the top right and click "Your repositories"

In the repository name field, name it exactly the same as your github username
and add .github.io to the end
Using this format: (username.github.io)

Set your repository to public and click "Create repository" at the bottom of the screen

Once you've done this, click on the upload files button and drag and drop your overlay folder into github.
Click commit changes when done

Once you've done that, click into your folder and find the .css file

At the top you'll see the file location which should look along the lines of username.github.io / folder / code.css

Copy this.

Open gamepadviewer.com and click the three line hamburger menu at the top left of the screen
Click on Generate URL

At the bottom, you'll see "Edit CSS URL:"
In this field, paste that location you copied earlier
At the beginning of that, add on "https://" this will make it a full link

At the top you'll see your custom url which you can click on to copy

You can paste this into your browser or into a browser source in any streaming program you use.
After this simply resize to your liking and you'll be good to go!
